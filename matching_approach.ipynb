    "I clustered the selected units (weight = 1) into matched sets. In this approach, I designate a unit as the representative of a matched set and assign every other unit to one of these clusters. The cost for assigning unit j to cluster i is the Mahalanobis distance between their covariate vectors. In addition, I added a term in the objective to encourage forming more matched sets so that I'm are not forced into one giant matched set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken the ideas from the Zubizarreta’s paper, I extended the matching MIP to include additional constraints that target specific imbalance measures, which is the differences in covariate means. I penalizes imbalance in covariate totals across clusters directly in the objective function. ​It penalize imbalances in the covariate distributions within each cluster so that the units in each cluster have similar covariate distributions. For instance, for each potential matched set (cluster): Compute the cluster’s (weighted) average of each covariate. Then compare it to the overall mean for that covariate in the selected subset. Introduce auxiliary variables to capture the absolute difference (imbalance) between the cluster mean and the overall mean. Add to objective a weighted sum of these imbalance measures with weights chosen based on how much imbalance we want to penalize."
